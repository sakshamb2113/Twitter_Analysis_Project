You have been their inspiration to believe that ‘they are not too small to make a difference’. They have decided to write letters to the prime minister on this topic. pic.twitter.com/W9R8k0DdHu	1	Tweet

The whole accelerated climate change and environmental destruction situation is due to one major factor: over consumption due to overpopulation. Please help educate your generation to minimise the root cause. Keep up the great work!	0	Tweet
1136351789291364354	@teri9	2019-06-06 00:49:13	They said this exact same thing in the 60’s, that Earth would be extinct by 2020. Lies. Fools. Useful Idiots. Climate *change* is natural. Not a crisis. The crisis is cutting ourselves off from needed blessings from God by turning our backs on Him. The End.	0	Tweet

1135610600518750209	@L3YTR	2019-06-03 23:44:00	You remind me of myself aged 16 in the sense I became terrified of co2 related climate change. I'm 30 now & understand it's nothing but corrupt science with a political agenda. Please shift your focus on pollution/ecocide/poverty instead of CO2 propaganda! X	0	Tweet

1134928618046406656	@alkier2_al	2019-06-02 02:34:03	Greta, AWG Climate Change is a hoax! Man cannot manipulate the earths climate by playing with a trace constituent like CO2 which comprises 4 in every 10,000 molecules in the atmosphere. Water vapour, which is 2,000 in 10,000 molecules has way more impact but is too hard to model.	0	Tweet
