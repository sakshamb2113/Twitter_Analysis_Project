1145991880154451973	@SteB777	2019-07-02 15:15:30	You think in a joined up way and see the big picture. Unfortunately most commentators on the climate crisis only see bits of the problem and do not engage in joined up thinking. Practically no climate change commentators factor in also addressing the biodiversity crisis as well.	1	Tweet

Could it be the leaders of these countries live in a "different world" of privilege and never experience the changes except to read about it if they get the time in their busy schedule? pic.twitter.com/FSHjykwmwz	6	Tweet

1145621811377397761	@ZioElsydeon	2019-07-01 14:44:59	Just these past few days, conservatives around major party CDU here in Germany doubled down on their nonsense that fighting the climate change (not even reckognising it's a crisis) mustn't burden the economy...completely failing to understand the entire point...to say the least..	5	Tweet
