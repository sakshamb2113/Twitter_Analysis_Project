1099312018614562816	@DrBeatBrunner	2019-02-23 19:46:24	To those saying weather is not climate: Correct! But there is a relation: Climate is also weather statistics. So if there is a single weather event, it's just part of statistics, if it repeats itself with the same trend (e.g. unusual extreme events) it's climate (climate change).	2	Tweet

Firstly W-European "summer" is only a facet of a typical blocking weather pattern which by the way causes bitter cold in the eastern parts.
