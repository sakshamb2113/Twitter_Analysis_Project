According 2 GOD'S WORD & actual events, the END is NEAR. No time for business as usual, STATUS QUO, moderate. If NOTHING else convinces us, Climate change (natural disasters), government corruption, Trump, McConnell, GOP should!!.	0	Tweet

It’s one of those [issues] where you can be too late and find, at least in human understanding and time horizons, it becomes irreversible. So I know of no issue that is more urgent than that.” https://autode.sk/2Q2e5ND pic.twitter.com/QrNvpIGri3	0	Tweet

My country is burning, we're only 1/3 of the way through the hottest summer on record, and we have a political class that isn't taking legitimate action on climate change. We need your voice. Please show your followers what is happening in Australia right now.	0	Tweet
