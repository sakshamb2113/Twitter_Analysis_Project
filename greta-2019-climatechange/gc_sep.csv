First it was Global warming, and when that was proven wrong, the same people who lied about that changed it to Climate Change. Winter is coming and it will get cold, Spring, then Summer.

How about you have your Soros handler take you to China and chew them out for being by far the biggest contributor to climate change ? https://unearthed.greenpeace.org/2019/03/28/china-new-coal-plants-2030-climate/amp/ …	0	Tweet

Whenever anyone tries to frame climate change as an individual responsibility issue, you need to fight back. 71% of global emissions are caused by 100 companies. The world won't be saved by banning plastic straws or forgoing meat on their own.	0	Tweet
