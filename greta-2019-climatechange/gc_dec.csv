If we continue to cut down the rainforest, global climate is affected and green energy usage in the west is irrelevant. There needs to be a moratorium on rainforest decline.	0	Tweet

1210479888165228549	@StarLands3	2019-12-27 14:07:49	@ GretaThunberg The latest science confirms that human impact on climate change is insignificant, this is now a fact. But this does not by any means justify poluting air, land and water the way we are doing. So, although I think you are not 100% well informed I salute you!	0	Tweet

No way do you have the extensive knowledge to lecture the world on climate change, and are a mere puppet for those with a sinister agenda. Wake up. Research El Nino and La Nina. Research climate history!	3	Tweet

Not how each and all behave, but the numbers. 100 years ago we were 2 billion people. Nowadays it’s over 7.2 billion people. We must stop growing as of now. Thanks	0	Tweet
