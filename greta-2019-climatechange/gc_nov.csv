They have actively manipulated the weather since the 1920s. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZFGuoayptQ&t=2758s … Ask @ DrDavidKeith he'll teach you about geoengineering	0	Tweet

But occasionally take off the mask so you can see the light ! 12 years later what will you say when Climate Change doesn't happen , what then? Oh yeah by that time your parents will have used you up and spent all that money! pic.twitter.com/O9x9kAYTHm	0	Tweet

If you'd any brains you'd have explored your brain, imagined, reasoned, fantasized, realized the compass of will, instinct and impulses and then read up on WMD's. How long do you we can go without using what we have? Climate change won't have a chance.	0	Tweet
1190077237879541761	@ShoolTom	2019-11-01 06:54:58	@ GretaThunberg go back to school and learn. You’ve been brainwashed regarding climate change. Start by studying about the earths axis and orbital cycles. For the rest of your life the average temperatures will continue to creep higher. But with very little to do with mankind. pic.twitter.com/Fg09e2IfNe	0	Tweet
