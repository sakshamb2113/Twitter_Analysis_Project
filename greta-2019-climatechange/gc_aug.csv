If climate change was real they would buy on mountain tops.. I have heard my whole life climate change is an immediate threat to life and land. Yet no loss of land or life	0	Tweet

She's being portrayed as the environmental saviour of the planet, when she's just a teenage girl putting forward scientific facts about climate change. She can speak, we adults must listen & act. pic.twitter.com/1E6mD6iRTA	0	Tweet

1156852041156833280	@LODweb	2019-08-01 14:29:54	Also, a majority of media is owned by few capitalists against changement, because it will cost money to them and their puppets/politics ; but as it will challenge their life - climate change is for all - there is a hope, and you count in that process :)	0	Tweet

He's a controversial and offensive journalist, who incites anger in the community if you dare to tell the truth about climate change.	2	Tweet

1156848761555050497	@indieandluna	2019-08-01 14:16:52	The irresponsiblity of journalists like Andrew Bolt is a huge contributory factor to climate change denial - they need called out by governments, their peers and the public	1	Tweet
1156848447342940161	@VictorPessolato	2019-08-01 14:15:37	Hi Greta I don't know if you seen this already, if not I totally recommend checking this video about 13 misconceptions about climate change. You are probably well aware about the research he mentioned, but I thought it is a very accessible video. https://youtu.be/OWXoRSIxyIU	0	Tweet
1156848048972214274	@joabbess	2019-08-01 14:14:02	. @ GretaThunberg Will you talk to the fossil fuel companies and ask them about strategies for Zero Carbon Transition? I want to hear what BP, Royal Dutch Shell & ExxonMobil are going to do to prevent dangerous climate change. We need the Carbon Majors to act as well as governments	1	Tweet

1156830529678798848	@odoylepaul	2019-08-01 13:04:25	@ GretaThunberg Love what u are doing, you are an inspiration! Was reminded the other day that in NZ we introduced carless days in 1979 (unfortunately due to an oil shortage and not the climate) for a short period. I was thinking how powerful this would be to tackle climate change	0	Tweet
1156825715091890176	@FayaBogush	2019-08-01 12:45:17	@ GretaThunberg (and her team) are sailing (on a high tech boat, imagine the effect on climate to manufacture it. Not mentioning the Internet). None of them doing anything to make us believe in climate change. https://twitter.com/MCFWKellermann/status/1156822300399939584 …	0	Retweet
