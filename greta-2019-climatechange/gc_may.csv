Due to human emissions climate will change, it will not break down. If we indeed manage to keep warming below 1.5 degree, crises might be even avoided.	0	Tweet

1123904979033645059	@rknecho	2019-05-02 16:30:02	@ GretaThunberg The truth is that no matter how anyone attacks you, it doesn't alter the truth of climate change. How infantile of adults to fail to that degree that they think "yelling" at you will make that truth stop.	0	Tweet

Planets heat up and then cool down constantly repeating this cycle. Have been doing this for millennia and will continue to do so long after Humans cease to exist. It’s basic science.	0	Tweet

1123709634311794696	@wunderlauch	2019-05-02 03:33:48	So grateful for the hope you are giving. With all due respect, though, I think that unless there is a # BasicIncome “we” / politics / organization cant implement meaningful actions against climate change, loss of biodiversity etc.	0	Tweet

1123645125987655685	@JSamoraj	2019-05-01 23:17:29	@ GretaThunberg Remember that climate change seems to be like a Rubik's Cube-like puzzle that could be solved if only people could find determination and if leaders or their advisers could swivel the right blocks of the ultimate solution in the right order.
